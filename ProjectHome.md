This program can:

1. Compute for the probability given a set of input parameters

2. Compute for the total probability for a range of values for random variable x

3. Show the probability in tabular form for the random variable x

4. Graph the probability distribution

5. Show a simulation of the graph as n increases (given a fixed N and k), and as k increases (given a fixed N and n)
